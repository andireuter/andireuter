In 2021 I founded [NO DANCE MONKEY](https://www.nodancemonkey.com). I work together with a very talented illustrator and 3D designer to give joy, education and fun to all kids and families across the world. Let's meet us on [nodancemonkey.com](https://www.nodancemonkey.com) - stay tuned for our first kids app and image book.

I received my product design certification in 2023 and I started to learn the programming language [**Go**](https://www.golang.org). My life is too short not to just do it. :grin:

Since 2024 I study marketing. It's amazing how much value marketing knowledge gives back to my businesses. ðŸ”¥
